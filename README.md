Twinger

Description
-----------

Tiny app to mimic (mock?) finger on Twitter.

Remember when `finger` was a thing? Probably not. But once upon a time you could type:

    bash$ finger bson@gnu.ai.mit.edu

And get some neat results:

    [apple-gunkies.gnu.ai.mit.edu]
    User     Real Name         What    Idle  TTY  Host      Console Location
    bson     Jan Brittenson     fgrep          *p0 apple-gu (nutrimat.gnu.ai.)

Now you can do the same with Twitter:

    $ twinger stephenfry
    [stephenfry@twitter.com]
    User        Real Name   What
    stephenfry  Stephen Fry British Actor, Writer, Lord of Dance, Prince of Swimwear & Blogger


Requirements
------------

* `json`
